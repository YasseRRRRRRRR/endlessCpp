/*

    arrays can find its elements using an index
    arrays have a fixed size
    when you allocate memory for an arrays it stays the same forever which means you can add or take anything from it   
    since elements are ordered by indexes you know the location of each elements since you know it's index

*/



/*
    linked lists have two values the value of the element and a pointer that pointer that points to next untill the final one
    linked lists have dynamic size
    you can add and remove elements freely
    1 points to 2 points to 3 points to 4 points to 5
    since the linked elements are linked this way you can't access forexample element 4 directly
    you have to go all the way from 1 since it's the only element you know the location

    need more memory since you store two values the pointer as well as element value
